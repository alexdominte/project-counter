## Requirements Fulfilled

- The application is developed entirely with **vanilla JavaScript**.
- **No use of frameworks** (e.g., React, Angular, Vue) or libraries like jQuery.
- The **+/- buttons** and the **counter display** are dynamically created and manipulated in the DOM using JavaScript.
- Functions to increment and decrement the counter value are implemented as per the requirements.
- Additional functionality such as a reset button and hover effects for better user experience is included.

## Features

- **Increment Button (+):** Increases the counter value by 1.
- **Decrement Button (-):** Decreases the counter value by 1.
- **Reset Button:** Resets the counter value to 0.
- **Dynamic Counter Display:** The counter value updates in real-time.
- **Hover Effects:** Buttons have a smooth shadow effect on hover.
- **Responsive Design:** Styled with a gradient background and centered layout for optimal viewing experience.

## Technologies Used

1. **HTML:** For structuring the content.
2. **CSS:** For styling the application, including the background gradient and button hover effects.
